This folder contains Python example scripts that illustrate the
usage of the ctatools.

binned_analysis.py
  Example Python pipelines for binned analysis.
  The first pipeline writes intermediate results to the disk while
  the second pipeline keeps the results in memory.
  If matplotlib is installed on the system the fitted spectrum
  and the observed offset angle distribution is displayed in
  counts space.

sensitivity_pull.py
  This script creates pull distributions as function of energy
  for a test source that is at the 5 sigma sensitivity limit for
  50h of effective observing time.
  If the Python processing module is installed the script can make
  use of multiple cores and runs in parallel.

show_pull_histogram.py
  Displays pull histograms from pull data generated by the
  cspull script.

ts_distributions.py
  This script creates TS distributions as function of energy for
  an off observation of 50h effective observing time.
  If the Python processing module is installed the script can make
  use of multiple cores and runs in parallel.

unbinned_analysis.py
  Example Python pipelines for unbinned analysis.
  The first pipeline writes intermediate results to the disk while
  the second pipeline keeps the results in memory.
  If matplotlib is installed on the system the fitted spectrum
  and the observed offset angle distribution is displayed in
  counts space.
