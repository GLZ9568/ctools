This folder contains Python example scripts that illustrate the
usage of the ctools.

benchmark_cta_analysis.py
  This script peforms a benchmark of the various CTA analysis types
  (unbinned, binned, stacked), and if matplotlib is installed, creates
  a plot of the benchmark results.

check_models.py
  Checks a variety of models using an unbinned analysis.

make_pull_at_sensitivity_limit.py
  This script creates pull distributions as function of energy
  for a test source that is at the 5 sigma sensitivity limit for
  50h of effective observing time. It takes as input file the
  output file generated using cspull.
  If the Python processing module is installed the script can make
  use of multiple cores and runs in parallel.

make_spectrum.py
  This script shows how to make a spectrum using obsutils.

make_survey.py
  This script simulates a CTA galactic plane survey.

make_ts_distributions.py
  This script creates TS distributions as function of energy for
  an off observation of 50h effective observing time.
  If the Python processing module is installed the script can make
  use of multiple cores and runs in parallel.

benchmark_cta_analysis.py
  Performs performance benchmarks of the various CTA analysis types.

pipeline_binned_disk.py
  Example pipeline for simulating events and performing a binned
  analysis by saving intermediate results to disk.

pipeline_binned_mem.py
  Example pipeline for simulating events and performing a binned
  analysis in memory. No files will be written to disk.

pipeline_stacked_disk.py
  Example pipeline for simulating events and performing a stacked
  analysis by saving intermediate results to disk.

pipeline_stacked_mem.py
  Example pipeline for simulating events and performing a stacked
  analysis in memory. No files will be written to disk.

pipeline_unbinned_disk.py
  Example pipeline for simulating events and performing an unbinned
  analysis by saving intermediate results to disk.

pipeline_unbinned_mem.py
  Example pipeline for simulating events and performing an unbinned
  analysis in memory. No files will be written to disk.

show_butterfly.py
  Displays a butterfly generated using the ctbutterfly tool.

show_pha.py
  Displays a spectrum in PHA format.

show_pull_histogram.py
  Displays pull histograms generated by the cspull script.

show_response.py
  Display one or several CTA response functions.

show_ts_distribution.py
  Displays Test Statistic histograms generated using the cstsdist
  script.
