ctools are a set of ftools-like executables needed for the scientific analysis
of Cherenkov Telescope Array data. ctools is also a Python module
that allows for interactive data analysis and building of analysis
scripts and pipelines. ctools includes also an observation simulator
to enable the scientific simulation of future CTA observations.

ctools are based on GammaLib, a versatile toolbox for
the high-level analysis of astronomical gamma-ray data. Besides CTA,
GammaLib supports also the analysis of Fermi-LAT data, and extensions
to support further gamma-ray instruments are planned. This enables a
simultaneous and coherent multi-instrument analysis of high-energy
sources in the Universe.
