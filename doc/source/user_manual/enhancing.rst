Enhancing ctools
================

Most ctools users will run the existing ctools or cscripts,
which cover the most common simulation and analysis needs.

Advanced users and developers can write their own tools and scripts.
The following C++ and Python examples can help get you started:

* :doxy:`ctlike`
* :doxy:`obsutils`
* :doxy:`cstsdist`
