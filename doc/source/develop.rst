=======

ctools is an open source projet and you are highly welcome to contribute 
to the development.
Contributions can come in any areas: writing C++ code, contributing Python 
scripts, writing documentation, testing code, etc.

The ctools software development is managed by a
`Redmine <https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/ctools/>`_ platform.
Please check out the 
`Wiki <https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/ctools/wiki/Contributing_to_ctools>`_
on that platform to learn how you can contribute to the ctools software
development.

You may also want to get in the ctools information flow by subscribing to 
the ctools@irap.omp.eu mailing list.
To subscribe simply send an e-mail to ctools-subscribe@irap.omp.eu.

We are organising regular `Coding sprints <https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/ctools/wiki/Coding_sprints>`_
to allow newcomers to get familiar with the code base and the coding
practices.
You are highly invited to join one of the next coding sprints.

You can also follow `@ctools_software <https://twitter.com/ctools_software>`_ on
twitter to get informed about new ctools releases.
