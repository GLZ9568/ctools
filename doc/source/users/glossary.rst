.. topic:: First CTA Data Challenge

   The goal of the first CTA Data Challenge is to enable the CTA Consortium
   Science Working Groups to derive science benchmarks for the CTA Key Science
   objectives.

   The first CTA Data Challenge should provide quantitative estimates of CTA's
   science capabilities that will enable the CTA Consortium Science Working
   Groups to evaluate science trade-offs in the future. The first CTA Data
   Challenge should also result in numerous show cases, including for example
   images, spectra and light curves, that can be used to illustrate CTA's
   science case, and that should enrich the CTA outreach material. And the
   first CTA Data Challenge should also stimulate the enrichment of the CTA
   Science Case.
