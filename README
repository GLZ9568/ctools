What's new in this release?
===========================
See the files "NEWS" and "ChangeLog".


What are the ctatools anyway?
=============================
ctatools are ftools-like executable for the scientific analysis of
CTA observations. They are based on GammaLib, a vesatile toolbox 
for the high-level analysis of astronomical gamma-ray data.

The following tools are so far available:

    ctobssim - simulation of CTA observations
    ctselect - event selection
    ctbin    - event binning
    ctlike   - maximum likelihood model fitting


Web sites
=========
http://cta.irap.omp.eu/ctatools            - ctatools documentation
http://gammalib.sourceforge.net            - for GammaLib documentation
https://sourceforge.net/projects/gammalib/ - for GammaLib downloads


Prerequisites
=============
ctatools require GammaLib. Please refer to http://gammalib.sourceforge.net
for instructions about how to install GammaLib. The GammaLib code can
be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/gammalib/.

Once GammaLib is properly installed, make sure that you added the setup
script to your .bashrc or $HOME/.profile script:

    export GAMMALIB=/usr/local/gamma
    source $GAMMALIB/bin/gammalib-init.sh

If you use C shell or a variant then add the following to your
.cshrc or .tcshrc script:

    setenv GAMMALIB /usr/local/gamma
    source $GAMMALIB/bin/gammalib-init.csh

If you have installed GammaLib in another directory than /usr/local/gamma,
please adapt the path correspondingly.

Please do NOT attempt to install ctatools in a directory different to that
of GammaLib. The setup procedure does NOT support this feature, although
you might manage to make it work :-)


Unix Installation
=================
To build and install ctatools, simply type the following:

     % ./configure
     % make
     % make install

By default ctatools installs itself in /usr/local/gamma.  If you need to
install ctatools in a different location or in your home directory, use
the --prefix option to ./configure.  For example:

     % ./configure --prefix=/home/yourname/projects
     % make
     % make install

The file INSTALL details more about using configure. Also try

     % ./configure --help.


Macintosh OS X Installation
============================
ctatools are known to work on various flavors of OS X.  Follow the Unix
installation instructions above.


Solaris Installation
====================
ctatools compile on Solairs, but there is an issue with using it as a
shared library (see "Known problems" below).


Testing
=======
If you want to test ctatools before installation, type the following:

     % make check

Known problems
==============
Solaris
  Although ctatools compile on Solaris using the Sun compiler, there are
  problems with global symbols in the shared GammaLib library that prevent
  the model registry to work correctly. Furthermore, GammaLib is not able
  to catch its own exceptions, which prevents the FITS interface to work
  correctly. Possible it will work using gcc on Solaris, yet this has not
  so far been tested.
