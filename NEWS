1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes executable by executable the most
important changes made since the last release of ctools.


2. Configuration
-----------------
The configure options --enable-universalsdk and --with-universal-archs
have been added to control building of universal libraries.  This is
particularily required if the installed Python architecture differs from
the default architecture created by the compiler.

Remove automake dependency tracking as this conflicts with Mac OS X
universal builds.


3. Python interface
-------------------
The Python binding building scheme from GammaLib has been adapted.
This avoids double compilation during 'make' and performs a special
build during 'make check' that provides a Python module which is
statically linked to the ctools library.


4. ctobssim - CTA observation simulation
----------------------------------------
None


5. ctselect - CTA event selection
---------------------------------
Added handling of observation definition XML files. ctselect can now
operate on single FITS files or on observation definition XML files.

If an observation definition XML file is used on input, selected event 
list(s) will be written in the current working directory by prepending
a prefix to the filename after stripping any path information. The
event list filenames in the input XML file are replaced by the selected
event list filenames, and the result is written as XML file in the
file specified by the outfile parameter.

The output event list or observation definition file parameter is
not queried any longer as first parameter. This gives a more logicial
parameter interface where input parameters are queried first.


6. ctbin - CTA event binning
----------------------------
Added handling of observation definition XML files. ctbin can now
operate on single FITS files or on observation definition XML files.

If an observation definition XML file is used on input, counts map(s) 
will be written in the current working directory by prepending a prefix
to the filename after stripping any path information from the event
filenames. The event list filenames in the input XML file are replaced
by the counts map filenames, and the result is written as XML file in the
file specified by the outfile parameter.

The output counts map or observation definition file parameter is
not queried any longer as first parameter. This gives a more logicial
parameter interface where input parameters are queried first.


7. ctlike - CTA maximum likelihood fitting
------------------------------------------
Added handling of observation definition XML files. ctlike can now
operate on single FITS files or on observation definition XML files.

The analysis method is now determined from the input file type,
and consequently, the method parameter has been removed. Furthermore,
the evfile and cntmap parameters have been combined in a single infile
parameter.

The output model file parameter is not queried any longer as first
parameter. This gives a more logicial parameter interface where input
parameters are queried first.


8. ctskymap - CTA sky mapping
-----------------------------
New executable.
