1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes executable by executable the most
important changes made since the last release of ctools.


2. Configuration
-----------------
Added OpenMP support to allow for code parallelization. If available,
OpenMP is enabled by default. OpenMP support may be disabled using
the --disable-openmp flag.


3. Python interface
-------------------
None


4. ctobssim - CTA observation simulation
----------------------------------------
If several observations are processed at once, ctobssim now outputs
an observation definition XML file and separate FITS files for each
observation. The filenames of the FITS files will be written to the
observation definition file.

The executable now also benefits from OpenMP support, allowing for
parallelized simulation of events in the presence of multiple
processor cores.


5. ctselect - CTA event selection
---------------------------------
None


6. ctbin - CTA event binning
----------------------------
None


7. ctlike - CTA maximum likelihood fitting
------------------------------------------
ctlike computes now the total number of observed events and dumps
them in the log file just before it dumps the number of predicted
events. It also computes the difference between observed and
predicted events so that the difference is immediately visible.


8. ctskymap - CTA sky mapping
-----------------------------
None


9. Examples
-----------
None


10. Scripts
-----------
None


11. caldb
---------
None


12. models
----------
None
