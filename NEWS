1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes executable by executable the most
important changes made since the last release of ctools.


2. Configuration
-----------------
None


3. Python interface
-------------------
None


4. ctobssim - CTA observation simulation
----------------------------------------
ctobssim was not fully thread save as the models were shared among the
threads which led to concurrent memory access when evaluating the Monte
Carlo cache. The models are now copied within the parallel section,
avoiding concurrent memory access (#1258).

ctobssim now also supports the handling of energy dispersion. Energy
dispersion can be switched on or off using the hidden edisp parameter.


5. ctselect - CTA event selection
---------------------------------
The temporary file is now properly close to avoid file opening errors
when iterating over ctselect (#1149).


6. ctbin - CTA event binning
----------------------------
None


7. ctlike - CTA maximum likelihood fitting
------------------------------------------
ctlike now has full access to the calibration database, allowing
the use for 2D response functions in FITS files.

ctlike now also supports the handling of energy dispersion. Energy
dispersion can be switched on or off using the hidden edisp parameter.


8. ctskymap - CTA sky mapping
-----------------------------
None


9. ctmodel - CTA counts map modelling
-------------------------------------
ctmodel now has full access to the calibration database, allowing
the use for 2D response functions in FITS files.

ctmodel now also supports the handling of energy dispersion. Energy
dispersion can be switched on or off using the hidden edisp parameter.

10. ctexpcube - CTA exposure cube
---------------------------------
The first version of the ctexpcube tool is included in the release.
ctexpcube computes the exposure cube for an observation definition
file. The cube definition may be taken from a counts map or may be
specified by user parameters.


11. Examples
------------
None


12. Scripts
-----------
Add logL and event statistics to cspull output file.

Convert all tabs into spaces.

The obsutils script has now been moved into the ctools module namespace.


13. caldb
---------
None


14. models
----------
None
