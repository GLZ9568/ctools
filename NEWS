1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes executable by executable the most important changes made since the last release of ctatools.


2. Configuration
-----------------
The configuration script aborts now if no C++ compiler is found.

Added ctatools-init.sh, ctatools-init.csh and ctatools-setup
scripts. They needed to be called when ctatools is installed
in a location that differs from GammaLib, so that the 
environment is set up correctly also for this case. If ctatools
is in the same location as GammaLib, these scripts do not need
to be used.
