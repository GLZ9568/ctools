1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes executable by executable the most
important changes made since the last release of ctools.


2. Configuration
-----------------
The clang++ compiler takes now only precedence over the g++ compiler
if the system on which compilation is performed is Mac OS X 10.7 or
later.

If Python bindings are disabled we omit now all the Python related
checks during configuration. This includes detection of the Python
executable, detection of the swig executable, and the checks for the
presence of the Python wrapper files.

The Apple gcc compiler requires the gomp_thread_attr global to be
defined when OpenMP functions are called without having any OpenMP
section in the code. This specific requirement is now detected in
the configure script using some dedicated test code, and the compile
definition HAVE_OPENMP_DARWIN_KLUGE is set that allows inclusion of
the appropriate code when needed.

Furthermore, the OPENMP_LIB_LDFLAGS is not set to -lgomp on Darwin
anymore as this appears not to be needed.

The MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable is now only exported
when the --enable-universalsdk option is specified. This solved problems
related to uncatched exceptions in unit tests. Possibly, these uncatched
exceptions were due to weak linking, a feature that exists since Mac OS
X version 10.2. By not exporting MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET, Mac OS X
version 10.1 is assumed.

The Python bindings configuration has been improved to handle also
the MacPorts gcc compiler on Mac OS X. Static linking during unit
testing has been removed as this is no longer needed (don't ask me why).
The double compilation for unit check has also be removed. A static
link is used instead that allows adding of the wrapper directory to
the PYTHONPATH.

The TEST_ENV_DIR environment variable is also added to the load
library path in the GammaLib setup script. This ensures the correct
loading of shared libraries in non-standard locations.
