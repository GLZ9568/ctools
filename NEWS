1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes executable by executable the most
important changes made since the last release of ctools.


2. Configuration
-----------------
Some hyphens were missing in the configuration script when synchronising
the user and system parameter files. This led to an error message on the
console, but did not impact the proper configuration. Hyphens have now
been added as needed.

The configuration test script testconf.sh has been added to allow testing
configuration script during continous integration.


3. Python interface
-------------------
None


4. ctobssim - CTA observation simulation
----------------------------------------

changed now that only events will be simulated when the instrument
and id are valid for a given model.
