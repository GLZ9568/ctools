1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes executable by executable the most
important changes made since the last release of ctools.


2. Configuration
-----------------
None


3. Python interface
-------------------
None


4. ctobssim - CTA observation simulation
----------------------------------------
Adapt to new GTime interface. The time parameters are now given in the CTA
time reference.

A bug was corrected that prevented correct usage of the seed value. The
introduction of OpenMP support in version 0.5.0 led to an internal seed
value of 0 event if different seed parameters were specified. The bug
was corrected and the internal seed values that are used are now dumped
into the log file.


5. ctselect - CTA event selection
---------------------------------
Adapt to new GTime interface. The time parameters are now given in the CTA
time reference.


6. ctbin - CTA event binning
----------------------------
None


7. ctlike - CTA maximum likelihood fitting
------------------------------------------
None


8. ctskymap - CTA sky mapping
-----------------------------
None


9. ctmodel - CTA counts map modelling
-------------------------------------
The executable ctmodel has been added. ctmodel takes a model XML file
and computes the corresponding model map. The definiton of the model
map is either taken from an input counts map or an observation
definiton file, or from the task parameters with an interface that
is similiar to that of ctbin.


10. Examples
------------
None


11. Scripts
-----------
None


12. caldb
---------
None


13. models
----------
None
