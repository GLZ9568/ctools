1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes executable by executable the most
important changes made since the last release of ctools.


2. Configuration
-----------------
None


3. Python interface
-------------------
None


4. ctobssim - CTA observation simulation
----------------------------------------
ctobssim was not fully thread save as the models were shared among the
threads which led to concurrent memory access when evaluating the Monte
Carlo cache. The models are now copied within the parallel section,
avoiding concurrent memory access (#1258).

ctobssim now also supports the handling of energy dispersion. Energy
dispersion can be switched on or off using the hidden edisp parameter.


5. ctselect - CTA event selection
---------------------------------
The temporary file is now properly close to avoid file opening errors
when iterating over ctselect (#1149).


6. ctbin - CTA event binning
----------------------------
WARNING: The philosophy behind the ctbin tool changed fundamentally!

ctbin now always produces a single counts cube on output. If a single
event list is specified on input, the functionnality is basically
unchanged. If multiple event lists are specified, however, events are
now merged into a single counts cube file. No observation definition
XML file is written anymore!

So far, ctbin still writes pointing information in the counts cube,
although this is not necessarily meaningful if merging event lists
with different pointings. In the long run, pointing information will
be summarized in a pointings definition file, and will be removed
from the counts cube header. The logic is that the pointing definition
is set to the map centre. This is only identical to the pointing in
case of binning a single event list and using the usepnt=yes option
(or specifying the pointing manually as the xref and yref parameters).


7. ctlike - CTA maximum likelihood fitting
------------------------------------------
ctlike now has full access to the calibration database, allowing
the use for 2D response functions in FITS files.

ctlike now also supports the handling of energy dispersion. Energy
dispersion can be switched on or off using the hidden edisp parameter.


8. ctskymap - CTA sky mapping
-----------------------------
None


9. ctmodel - CTA counts map modelling
-------------------------------------
ctmodel now has full access to the calibration database, allowing
the use for 2D response functions in FITS files.

ctmodel now also supports the handling of energy dispersion. Energy
dispersion can be switched on or off using the hidden edisp parameter.

10. ctexpcube - CTA exposure cube
---------------------------------
The first version of the ctexpcube tool is included in the release.
ctexpcube computes the exposure cube for an observation definition
file. The cube definition may be taken from a counts map or may be
specified by user parameters.


11. ctcubemask - CTA cube filtering
-----------------------------------
The first version of the ctcubemask tool is included in the release.
ctcubemask allows filtering of bins in a counts cube by setting the
bin content to -1. Filtering can be done by energy, for a circular
Region of Interest (ROI) or using ds9 exclusion regions.

12. Examples
------------
None


13. Scripts
-----------
Add logL and event statistics to cspull output file.

Convert all tabs into spaces.

The obsutils script has now been moved into the ctools module namespace.


14. caldb
---------
None


15. models
----------
None
