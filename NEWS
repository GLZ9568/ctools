1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes executable by executable the most
important changes made since the last release of ctools.


2. Configuration
-----------------
Some hyphens were missing in the configuration script when synchronising
the user and system parameter files. This led to an error message on the
console, but did not impact the proper configuration. Hyphens have now
been added as needed.

The configuration test script testconf.sh has been added to allow testing
configuration script during continous integration.


3. Python interface
-------------------
None


4. ctobssim - CTA observation simulation
----------------------------------------
The instrument and id attributes provided by an observation were not
considering when simulating source and background events. This has been
changed now that only events will be simulated when the instrument
and id are valid for a given model.

ctobssim now has full access to the calibration database, allowing
the use for 2D response functions in FITS files.

ctobssim now also supports the handling of energy dispersion. Energy
dispersion can be switched on or off using the hidden edisp parameter.


5. ctselect - CTA event selection
---------------------------------
None


6. ctbin - CTA event binning
----------------------------
None


7. ctlike - CTA maximum likelihood fitting
------------------------------------------
ctlike now has full access to the calibration database, allowing
the use for 2D response functions in FITS files.

ctlike now also supports the handling of energy dispersion. Energy
dispersion can be switched on or off using the hidden edisp parameter.


8. ctskymap - CTA sky mapping
-----------------------------
None


9. ctmodel - CTA counts map modelling
-------------------------------------
ctmodel now has full access to the calibration database, allowing
the use for 2D response functions in FITS files.

ctmodel now also supports the handling of energy dispersion. Energy
dispersion can be switched on or off using the hidden edisp parameter.


10. Examples
------------
None


11. Scripts
-----------
The obsutils.py script has been adapted to the new calibration database
interface.


12. caldb
---------
None


13. models
----------
None
