1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes executable by executable the most
important changes made since the last release of ctools.

With version 00-08-00, GammaLib has undergone a major interface
change. The adaption of ctools to this interface changed will not be
detailed below as they do not impact the functionalities.


2. Configuration
-----------------
None


3. Python interface
-------------------
None


4. ctobssim - CTA observation simulation
----------------------------------------
The application now checks for each event whether it lies within the
circular region of interested defined by the region centre (parameters
ra and dec) and region radius (parameter rad). A margin of 0.5 has been
added internally to the radius so that also sources at the edge but
slightly outside of the ROI will be simulated correctly.

ctobssim now supports any kind of data space model for background
simulations, using the abstract mc() method that is now available
in the GModelData base class.


5. ctselect - CTA event selection
---------------------------------
None


6. ctbin - CTA event binning
----------------------------
The ebinalg parameter is now used to specify the type of binning.
Linear (LIN) binning and binning retrieved from a FITS file (FILE)
is now supported. For the latter, an extension named EBOUNDS or
ENERGYBINS is expected.

The ebinalg and ebinfile parameters are now automatic.

Counts maps generated by ctbin now have the longitude increasing
towards the left.


7. ctlike - CTA maximum likelihood fitting
------------------------------------------
None


8. ctskymap - CTA sky mapping
-----------------------------
Skymaps generated by ctskymap now have the longitude increasing
towards the left.


9. ctmodel - CTA counts map modelling
-------------------------------------
Model maps generated by ctmodel now have the longitude increasing
towards the left.


10. Examples
------------
None


11. Scripts
-----------
None


12. caldb
---------
None


13. models
----------
None
