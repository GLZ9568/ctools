1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes executable by executable the most important
changes made since the last release of ctools. The code complies to GammaLib
version 1.0.0 or above.


2. Configuration
-----------------
None


3. Python interface
-------------------
The ctools module does no longer import automatically Python scripts. This
prevents to break the ctools interface in case that some dependencies in
the scripts are broken. Scripts (such as obsutils, analysisutils or plotutils)
are support scripts that may not be fully supported throughout the
development. They may be moved into a special contributions area in the future.


4. Support model
----------------
None


5. ctobssim - CTA observation simulation
----------------------------------------
The rate check is now also correctly done for map cubes. Before, the rate check
made simulations with a diffuse map cube fail (#1452).


6. ctselect - CTA event selection
---------------------------------
If INDEF, UNDEF, NONE or UNDEFINED are passed for the selection parameters, no
selection will be performed.


7. ctbin - CTA event binning
----------------------------
None


8. ctlike - Maximum likelihood fitting
--------------------------------------
The bkgcube parameter has been added to allow specification of a background
cube for stacked analysis.


9. cttsmap - Generation of Test Statistics map
----------------------------------------------
The bkgcube parameter has been added to allow specification of a background
cube for stacked analysis.


10. ctskymap - CTA sky mapping
------------------------------
None


11. ctmodel - CTA counts cube modelling
---------------------------------------
The ctmodel tool can now be used for stacked analysis from the command line.
It directly makes use of the cube response to compute the model without using
the original IRF information. This makes generation of model cubes substantially
faster. The old method of accessing the IRF response for model computation is
still possible.

The bkgcube parameter has been added to allow specification of a background
cube for stacked analysis.


12. ctexpcube - CTA exposure cube generation
--------------------------------------------
None


13. ctpsfcube - CTA point spread function cube generation
---------------------------------------------------------
None


14. ctbkgcube - CTA background cube generation
----------------------------------------------
None


15. ctcubemask - CTA cube filtering
-----------------------------------
None


16. ctbutterfly - Generate butterfly diagrams
---------------------------------------------
The bkgcube parameter has been added to allow specification of a background
cube for stacked analysis.


17. ctulimit - Compute upper limit
----------------------------------
Added an initial version of the upper limit computation tool.

The bkgcube parameter has been added to allow specification of a background
cube for stacked analysis.


18. Examples
------------
None


19. Scripts
-----------
The user parameter interface of cssens has been modified. The script
now reads a source model that is used for sensitivity estimation.
This provides more flexibility in the choice of the model for
sensitivity estimation.

The csobsdef script has been added that allows creation of observation
definition XML files from colon separated value ASCII files. The
observation definition files from csobsdef can be fed to ctobssim for
simulation of multiple pointings in one shot. This enables for example
survey observations to be simulated in a single ctobssim run.


20. caldb
---------
None


21. models
----------
None
