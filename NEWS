1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes executable by executable the most important
changes made since the last release of ctools.


2. Configuration
-----------------
None


3. Python interface
-------------------
None


4. Support model
----------------
None


5. ctobssim - CTA observation simulation
----------------------------------------
The simulation energy range is subdivided internally to avoid having a too
large difference between simulation area and effective area. Before, there
was a simulation area of 19634954 m^2 that was applied to all energies, which
led to the simulation of a huge number of low energy photons that were thrown
away later due to the small effective area. Now, the energy range is subdivided
(controlled using the "eslices" parameter), and for each energy range, the
simulation area is computed from the maximum effective area in that energy
range multiplied by a security factor of 2. This leads to a much more efficient
simulation of low-energy events (#1673).

Any existing events in an event list are now removed before starting the
simulation to enable providing an existing event file on input from which
only the observation attributes are extracted (for example GTI, ROI, energy
range, etc.) while the measured events are replaced by the simulated ones
(#1663).


6. ctselect - CTA event selection
---------------------------------
The tool now allows the usage of non-default extension names for the event
and Good Time Intervals. If the events are not located in the "EVENTS"
extension, the extension name can be provided by appending the extension
name to the input file name using the syntax

    <filename>[<event extension name>]

where <filename> needs to be replaced by the name of the FITS file and
<event extension name> by the name of the FITS extension. ctselect also
extracts the name of the Good Time Intervals extension from the data sub-
space keywords provided in the header of the event file.

The user has now also the possibility to specify other extension names for
the events and the Good Time intervals upon writing of the selected output
file. The format of the "outobs" parameter for this is

    <filename>[<event extension name;GTI extension name>]

If only an event extension name is provided using

    <filename>[<event extension name>]

the original extension name will be kept for the GTIs. Changing only the
GTI extension name can be achieved using

    <filename>[;GTI extension name>]

The ctselect tool now can also write the output into the same file that
was input, replacing the initial event (and eventually also Good Time
Intervals) extensions.


7. ctbin - CTA event binning
----------------------------
None


8. ctlike - Maximum likelihood fitting
--------------------------------------
None


9. cttsmap - Generation of Test Statistics map

11. ctmodel - CTA counts cube modelling
---------------------------------------
None


12. ctexpcube - CTA exposure cube generation
--------------------------------------------
None


13. ctpsfcube - CTA point spread function cube generation

16. ctbutterfly - Generate butterfly diagrams
---------------------------------------------
None


17. ctulimit - Compute upper limit

18. cterror - Likelihood profile error computation

The output filename is now read ahead in case that the tool is executed
(#1700).

Added the csiactcopy script that copies IACT data from a remote machine to
the user's machine (#1661).
