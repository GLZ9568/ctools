This folder contains files used for unit testing and files that serve
as example scripts for ctatools.

test_ctatools.sh
  Unit test for ctatools executables.

test_python.py
  Unit test for ctatools Python interface.

example_binned.py
  Example Python pipelines for binned analysis.
  The first pipeline writes intermediate results to the disk while
  the second pipeline keeps the results in memory.
  If matplotlib is installed on the system the fitted spectrum
  and the observed offset angle distribution is displayed in
  counts space.

example_unbinned.py
  Example Python pipelines for unbinned analysis.
  The first pipeline writes intermediate results to the disk while
  the second pipeline keeps the results in memory.
  If matplotlib is installed on the system the fitted spectrum
  and the observed offset angle distribution is displayed in
  counts space.

example_models.py
  Example Python pipeline for unbind analysis that is executed
  on a number of models (point source, disk source, Gaussian
  source, Shell source).

example_survey.py
  This script illustrates how a survey can be simulated and analysed.
  The script can be easily extended to adapt specific survey
  strategies and simulated source models.
